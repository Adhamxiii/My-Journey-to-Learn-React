# FAQ Accordion App

Welcome to my FAQ Accordion App exercise! This repository showcases my progress in understanding React components and interactivity. In this exercise, I've built a simple FAQ accordion app using React, allowing users to interactively toggle and view frequently asked questions and their answers.

## About This Exercise

In this exercise, I've focused on implementing the following concepts:

- **Component Structure:** I've divided the app into separate components for better organization and reusability.
- **State Management:** Utilizing the `useState` hook to manage the state of each accordion item, enabling dynamic expansion and collapse behavior.
- **Mapping Data:** Dynamically rendering multiple FAQ items by mapping through an array of data.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Displaying the answer text when an accordion item is open, and hiding it when the item is closed.
- **Event Handling:** Implementing click events to toggle the open/close state of each accordion item.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server and view the FAQ Accordion App in your browser.

## Code Overview

- `App.js`: The main entry point of the application. Renders the `Accordion` component and passes the FAQ data to it.
- `Accordion.js`: The main container component responsible for rendering the individual `AccordionItem` components using data mapping.
- `AccordionItem.js`: Represents each FAQ item in the accordion. Manages the open/close state of the item and handles the click event.
