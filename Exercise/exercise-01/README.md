# Exercise: Flash Cards with React

Welcome to the README for my Flash Cards exercise using React. This exercise focuses on building a simple interactive flash cards application that toggles between displaying questions and answers upon clicking on each card. The exercise highlights the use of state management, conditional rendering, and event handling within a React application.

## Introduction

In this exercise, I've developed a React application that showcases a set of flash cards. Users can click on each card to toggle between displaying the question and its corresponding answer. This exercise demonstrates the principles of state management and conditional rendering to create an interactive learning experience.

## Project Overview

The app consists of the following key components:

- **FlashCards**: This component manages the state of the selected card using React's `useState` hook. It renders a list of flash cards, allowing users to click on each card to reveal its question or answer based on its current state.

## Learnings

Through this exercise, I've gained the following insights and learned important concepts:

- **State Management**: I've practiced state management in React using the `useState` hook to handle the selected card's state and toggle between question and answer views.

- **Conditional Rendering**: I've further solidified my understanding of conditional rendering by dynamically changing the content displayed on each card based on user interactions.

- **Event Handling**: I've improved my event handling skills by associating the `handleClick` function with card clicks, enabling the toggling of card views.

## What's Next

By completing this exercise, I've honed my skills in state management, conditional rendering, and event handling, all of which are essential in creating interactive and engaging React applications. I'm excited to apply these concepts to more complex projects in my journey to master React development.
