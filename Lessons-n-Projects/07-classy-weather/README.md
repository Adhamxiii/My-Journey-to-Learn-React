## How It Works

**Classy Weather** fetches weather data from the Open Meteo API. Here's how it works:

- When a user enters a location name and clicks the "Get Weather" button, the app sends a request to a geocoding API to get the latitude and longitude of the location.

- With the latitude and longitude, the app then sends a request to the Open Meteo API to fetch the weather forecast for that location.

- The weather data is displayed in a user-friendly format, including weather icons, temperatures, and day of the week.
