## Lessons and Learnings

During the development of WorldWise, I acquired valuable insights and knowledge in several key areas:

- **Routing and Single-Page Applications (SPAs):** I gained a deep understanding of how routing works in a single-page application (SPA) using React Router. SPAs offer a smooth user experience by loading content dynamically without full page refreshes.

- **CSS Modules:** I leveraged CSS Modules to encapsulate styles, making it easier to manage and avoid naming conflicts in my project. CSS Modules improved the maintainability of my stylesheets.

- **Nested Routes and Index Route:** Implementing nested routes allowed me to structure my application logically. With an index route as the parent, I could organize related routes and components efficiently.

- **Dynamic Routes With URL Parameters:** I learned how to create dynamic routes that adapt to URL parameters. This feature was crucial for displaying city details and handling user interactions.

- **Programmatic Navigation with `useNavigate`:** I discovered the power of programmatic navigation with the `useNavigate` hook. This allowed me to navigate users to specific pages within the application based on actions and events.

- **Context API:** The Context API was instrumental in managing global state and user authentication. It provided a seamless way to share data across components without prop drilling.

These lessons and learnings not only improved the development of WorldWise but also enhanced my overall understanding of React-based web applications. I'm excited to apply this knowledge to future projects.
