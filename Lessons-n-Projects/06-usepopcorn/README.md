## Description

The Movie Search App is a single-page application that interacts with the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API to retrieve movie data. Users can search for movies by entering keywords, view movie details including title, release year, runtime, IMDb rating, and plot. They can also add movies to their watched list and rate them.

## Features

- Search movies using keywords
- View movie details including IMDb rating, plot, and runtime
- Add movies to the watched list and rate them
- Toggle between movie search results and watched movie list

## Live Demo

## Usage

1. Open the app in your web browser.
2. Enter keywords in the search bar to find movies.
3. Click on a movie to view its details.
4. Rate and add movies to your watched list.
5. Toggle between the movie search results and your watched list.

## Components

The app is built using various components such as `NavBar`, `Search`, `MovieList`, `MovieDetails`, and more. These components are composed together to create the user interface.

## Lesson Overview

In this lesson, we cover the following topics:

- **State Management**: We explore various strategies for managing state within React components, including local state, lifting state, and using React's built-in `useState` hook.

- **Custom Hooks**: We learn how to create custom hooks to encapsulate and share functionality across components, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

- **Event Handling and Component Communication**: We deepen our understanding of event handling and the ways components can communicate with each other using props and custom hooks.

## Key Concepts Covered

- Managing state using React's built-in `useState` hook.
- Lifting state to parent components for better data flow and control.
- Creating and using custom hooks to encapsulate and share logic.
- Enhancing component communication and interaction through event handling.

## Lessons and Learnings

Throughout this lesson, we gain valuable insights and skills:

- **Effective State Management**: We learn to manage state efficiently within our React components, leading to more dynamic user interfaces.

- **Reusable Logic with Custom Hooks**: We discover how to create custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic across multiple components, improving code quality.

- **Enhanced Component Communication**: By deepening our understanding of event handling and communication strategies, we enhance user interactions and data flow.

## Hooks

The app uses custom hooks like `useKey` for handling keyboard events, `useLocalStorageState` for managing local storage state, and `useMovies` for fetching movie data from the OMDb API.
