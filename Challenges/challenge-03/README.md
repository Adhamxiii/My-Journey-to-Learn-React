# Challenge 3: Building a Dynamic Date Counter

Welcome to the README for my Challenge 3 code that involves building a dynamic date counter using React. This challenge delves into state management and date calculations to create a counter that calculates and displays dates based on user interactions.

## Introduction

In this challenge, I've developed a React application that features a dynamic date counter. Users can increment or decrement both the step value and the count value, which influence the displayed date. The challenge highlights the use of state management, event handling, and date calculations within a React application.

## Project Overview

The app consists of the following key components:

- **Counter**: This component manages both the count and step values using React's `useState` hook. It calculates and displays dates based on the count and step values and user interactions.

## Learnings

Through this challenge, I've gained the following insights and learned important concepts:

- **State Management**: I've practiced state management in React using the `useState` hook to maintain and update the count and step values.

- **Date Calculations**: I've explored how to perform date calculations based on user interactions and display them in a user-friendly format.

- **Event Handling**: I've further developed my event handling skills by associating functions with button clicks to manipulate the count and step values.

## Preview

Here's a visual preview of the Challenge 3 app:

## What's Next

By completing this challenge, I've expanded my understanding of state management and learned to apply it to real-world scenarios, such as dynamic date calculations. I'm excited to continue building more complex applications and exploring advanced concepts in my React learning journey.
