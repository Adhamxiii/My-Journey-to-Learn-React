## Introduction

Building upon the previous challenge, I aimed to enhance my personal portfolio card using React's dynamic capabilities. In this challenge, I've incorporated a dynamic skill list, each with its own level and visual representation.

## Project Overview

The project structure remains consistent, but with the following key additions:

- **Skills Array**: I've defined an array of skills, each including the skill name, skill level, and a color code for styling.

- **SkillList Component**: I've modified the `SkillList` component to map over the skills array and render each skill using the `Skill` component.

- **Skill Component**: The `Skill` component now receives skill-related data as props and displays the skill name, level indicator, and background color based on the skill's color code.

## Learnings

This challenge has allowed me to deepen my understanding and skills in the following areas:

- **Data Mapping**: I've practiced mapping over data arrays to dynamically render components with varying content.

- **Conditional Rendering**: I've utilized conditional rendering to display level indicators based on the skill's proficiency level.

- **Color Styling**: I've explored using color codes to dynamically style components based on skill-related attributes.

- **Project Evolution**: This challenge showcases how a project can evolve by building upon a previously established foundation, enhancing functionality and aesthetics.
