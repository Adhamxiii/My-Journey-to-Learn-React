![Currency Converter App Screenshot](./src/screenshot/demo.png)

The Currency Converter App is a simple web application built using React that allows users to convert currency values between different currencies. Users can input an amount, select the source currency (from) and the target currency (to), and the app will display the converted amount.

## Features

- Convert currency values between various currencies.
- Real-time currency conversion using the [Frankfurter API](https://www.frankfurter.app/).
- Dynamic updating of the converted amount upon input changes.
- User-friendly interface with selectable currencies.
- Loading indicator during currency conversion.

## Usage

1. Enter the amount you want to convert in the input field.
2. Select the source currency (from) from the first dropdown menu.
3. Select the target currency (to) from the second dropdown menu.
4. The converted amount will be displayed below the dropdowns. If the source and target currencies are the same, the converted amount will be the same as the input amount.
