## Description

Welcome to the README for the Tip Calculator App! This repository showcases the code for a simple Tip Calculator application built using React. The app allows users to calculate tips based on bill amount and service satisfaction percentages.

## App Overview

The Tip Calculator App provides the following features:

- Input for entering the bill amount.
- Dropdown menus to select satisfaction percentages for two individuals.
- Real-time calculation of the tip amount based on the selected percentages.
- Display of the total amount to be paid (bill + tip).
- Reset button to clear input and selections.

## Code Overview

The code is organized into functional components that make up the Tip Calculator App:

### `App.js`

The main component that renders the `TipCalculator` component.

### `TipCalculator.js`

The main app component that manages the state and logic of the tip calculation.

### `BillInput.js`

Component for entering the bill amount.

### `SelectPercentage.js`

Component for selecting satisfaction percentages.

### `Output.js`

Component for displaying the total amount to be paid.

### `Reset.js`

Component for resetting input and selections.

## How It Works

1. The user enters the bill amount in the input field.
2. Two dropdown menus allow the user to select the service satisfaction percentages for two individuals.
3. The app calculates the tip based on the average of the selected percentages and the bill amount.
4. The total amount to be paid (bill + tip) is displayed.
5. The user can reset the input and selections using the "Reset" button.

## Learning Points

Through building the Tip Calculator App, I learned and applied the following concepts:

- **State Management**: Utilizing the `useState` hook to manage and update state values.
- **Event Handling**: Handling user input and selections through event handlers.
- **Dynamic Calculations**: Performing real-time calculations based on user interactions.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying components conditionally based on input values.
- **Component Composition**: Creating modular components for reusability and maintainability.

## Future Enhancements

While the Tip Calculator App is functional, there are several ways to enhance it further:

- Implementing input validation to handle invalid bill amounts or percentages.
- Adding user authentication and storing calculation history.
- Enhancing the user interface with more visually appealing design and animations.
